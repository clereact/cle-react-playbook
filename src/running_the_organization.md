# Running the Organization

## Responsibilities

In order to build a successful meetup group, we have a few top-level responsibilities
that we need to account for as an organization.

- booking speakers and venues
  - locking down talk topics that align with our group
  - working through logistics of travel or presentation requirements
  - upcoming event need verification; make sure venue and speaker are ready and work through potential issues
  - day-of setup and logistics; includes signage, group alerts, managing venue technical needs
- community outreach / assistance
  - monitoring of community conversations and alerting issues
  - being availble for members to communicate with
  - providing and enforcing a code of conduct
  - requesting group feedback on ways to find interesting meeting topics
- group communications / promotion
  - scheduling events on Meetup.com
  - promoting upcoming events on Slack, social media, etc
- sponsorship; _while important, our needs are typically light in this department_
  - finding sources to sponsor food, events, the meetup, hosting, etc

## Leadership Group

To make sure that each of our top-level responsibilities are taken into account
we have a leadership group with enough members to provide overlap in each of
the areas mentioned above for those instances when volunteer time is not available.

The leadership group is what provides direction for our organization. This would
be a good chance for a person to help shape the meetup to be what theyâ€™d like it to be

If anyone is intersted in joining our leadership group, please let us know
what responsibilities you would like to assist with. We can also provide info on
areas where we'd like a bit more help with if you don't have one in mind.
